The IDL function kepler() solves Kepler's equation numerically, hopefully others
will find this little code useful, see kepler.pro for a more detailed description of
that solver, and have a look at test_kepler.pro to see how kepler() is used.
I have also written this code in C++ and Java and have benchmarked
all three codes; those other codes are uploaded to my github repositories at
https://github.com/joehahn?tab=repositories . All three codes solve
Kepler's equation for the eccentric anomaly E with errors < 10^(-15) radians
for N=10^7 elliptic orbits that have eccentricities logarithmically
distributed between 10^(-6)<e<0.999999. All three codes are executed on my
6 year old Dell Precision T3400. The C++ code executes in 4.25 seconds while
the Java code runs in 7.51 seconds and IDL takes 8.33 seconds to execute, so
the Java code is 1.8 times slower than the C++ equivalent and the IDL code is
2.0 times slower than C++. I also note that kepler() does work in GDL (the GNU
equivalent to IDL), and that test_kepler.pro almost works in GDL...GDL doesn't
execute the plot_oo commands that appear there. Interestingly the execution time
in GDL is 1.8 times slower than in IDL.
